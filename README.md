# Unity vs Unreal

| Unity | Unreal |
| ----- | ------ |
| Uses C# | Uses C++ |
| Faster, more responsive building experience | Slower, more laboured building experience |
| Simpler, more intuitive UI | UI is slightly more complicated and harder to navigate |

The community support for both seems to be about the same.  
A point worth noting is that **Unreal** does take a toll on weaker hardware specs.  

My device specs:
* MacBook Pro 13" (Early 2015)
* Dual core 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5
* 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 RAM
* Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB
